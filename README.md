# Machine_Learning_Project
used keras on top of tensor-flow to build Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict stock price  using historical closing price and trading volume

# Overview
This project utilizes Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm, to predict stock prices. For data with timeframes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) come in handy but recent researches have shown that LSTM, networks are the most popular and useful variants of RNNs.
